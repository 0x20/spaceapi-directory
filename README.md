OpenSpaceDirectory
==================

The Space API directory is a list of hackerspaces that have the Space API implemented.

If your hackerspace is missing in the list, fork the repository, add your space and create a pull request in Github.

This is a fork version of the official SpaceAPI, aimed to ease the process of adding a space and provide a stable API for the MyHackerspace Android application
