OpenSpaceDirectory
==================

The Space API directory is a list of hackerspaces that have the Space API
implemented.

If your hackerspace is missing in the list, fork the repository,
add your space and create a pull request in Github.

This is a fork version of the official [SpaceAPI](http://spaceapi.net),
aimed to ease the process of adding a space, provide a transparent and stable
API for the [MyHackerspace Android application](https://github.com/fixme-lausanne/MyHackerspace)
